              If you decide to cancel your project with Be Interior, you will
              not be charged for services that have not commenced or been
              processed at the time of your cancellation request. However, Be
              Interior cannot offer any refunds for services that have already
              been paid for, processed, initiated, or completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the tentative BOQ (Bill of Quantities) phase, any item or
              service can be modified, replaced, or removed before placing your
              Purchase Order and receiving an invoice. Once a purchase order has
              been placed and an invoice raised, modifications, replacements, or
              cancellations of any items will no longer be possible. Please
              don't worry; your Project Representative will review and confirm
              each item with you before raising an invoice.
